# Deep Story

Go deep into a story by adding a story within each word. Maybe like a mini internet? Not sure.

## Milestones

1. Basic CRUD for `story` ref types
2. Create, edit, and manage `mock` ref types
3. Add `resource` ref types
4. Add `task` ref types
5. Add teams
6. Deployment

### ‚úÖ Milestone 1: Basic CRUD for `story` ref types

- ‚è≥ Press esc or enter to un-select a Ref
- ‚úÖ Affordance to toggle title on/off
- ‚úÖ Add new ref creation component
- ‚úÖ Markdown
- ‚úÖ Create a new child ref from a word

### üöß Milestone 2: Create, edit, and manage `mock` ref types

Hopefully, this will be the first real "magic moment..."

- ‚úÖ Mock CRUD
- ‚úÖ Display Mock ref inline
- Design and style base refs page
- `/mocks` index page list of all mocks (use base refs page design)
- Link a ref to an existing mock (or any ref)
- ‚úÖ Show parent ref at the top of the story
- Refresh mock values
- Add custom parameters

- Auto-expanding text box
- ‚úÖ Add button `titles` (maybe tooltips)

### ‚è≥ Milestone 3: Add `resource` ref types

Important to demonstrate that it at least has the ambition to work with the outside world.

- Add a resource (can be website, doc, or image)
- Inline preview
- `/resources` index page list of all resources

### ‚è≥ Milestone 4: Add `task` ref types

This might change...but this was always an interesting feature of Quip, especially when they started doing things with tasks composed of structured data.

- Add a task list
- Todo list CRUD
- `/task` index page list of all tasks

### ‚è≥ Milestone 5: Add teams

### ‚è≥ Milestone 6: Deployment

### Later

- `/details` to show more info about the ref itself
- `/commands`, like `/fake` and the Faker tags
- Slash command that allow you to add an outgoing connection to another reference
- Show how many incoming and outgoing references there are to a reference
- Arrow up/down to select previous/next ref
