# Deep Story

Go deep into a story by adding a story within each word. Maybe like a mini internet? Not sure.

## Todos

[X] CRUD for story words
[X] Pressing enter saves a line break (could do something with this later)
[ ] Scalable meta-UI to hold many nested stories, do navigation (stories side by side, with some kind of breadcrumbs up top?)
[ ] Ability to add more words to the end of a line
[ ] Autofocus on the input, make it only as wide as the current input
[X] Switch to a monospaced font
[ ] Periodically create a backup JSON database that can be downloaded as a file
[ ] Database backup JSON uploader and parser
[ ] `/commands`, like `/fake` and the Faker tags
[ ] Slash command that allow you to add an outgoing connection to another reference
[ ] Show how many incoming and outgoing references there are to a reference
[ ] Add a router. Every reference needs a url
[X] Add user accounts...maybe just by hash for now? They become the root.
[ ] Url structure? just `/r/ID`?
[ ] Every reference has a type
[ ] Move hover tooltip tools to the toolbar
[ ] Store user data in localhost (with a hook?)
[X] Set up ContextAPI
