# Deep Story

Go deep into a story by adding a story within each word. Maybe like a mini internet? Not sure.

## Todos

- ✅ CRUD for story words
- ✅ Pressing enter saves a line break (could do something with this later)
- ✅ Scalable meta-UI to hold many nested stories, do navigation (stories side by side, with some kind of breadcrumbs up top?)
- ✅ Ability to add more words to the end of a line
- ✅ Autofocus on the input, make it only as wide as the current input
- ✅ Switch to a monospaced font
- Download backup (JSON?) for the collection
- Database backup JSON uploader and parser
- `/commands`, like `/fake` and the Faker tags
- Slash command that allow you to add an outgoing connection to another reference
- Show how many incoming and outgoing references there are to a reference
- ✅ Add user accounts...maybe just by hash for now? They become the root.
